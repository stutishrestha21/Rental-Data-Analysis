"
We found the data on data.gov. It contains information on hotels and motels in the LA neighborhood of New Orleans.
We created a shiny app to begin the analysis.
We divided latitude and longitude, which made it easier for us to locate various places on the map.
To determine the number of hotels and motels operating there, we then counted different company categories and created a bar graph.
We used a company start date and kept track of how many companies launched over the course of a decade in order to conduct further analyses.
To determine the terms that were utilized in the business type, we used emotional analysis.
The most repeated words were then counted once we had separated the words.
When we examine the top 5 companies in the Major Player in the Business graph,
we can see that Sonder is the largest chain when compared to the others. Additionally,
we developed a prediction model based on latitude and longitude that requests the user's input in order
to inform them of the location of each organization.
